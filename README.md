This is my Realm database sample application. 
<br><br>
<b>In this example you can find:</b><br>
- Different queries with plain and async transactions<br>
- Tables relationships, CRUD operations, <br>
- Primary key generation, chained join queries<br>
- Json serializing examples<br>
- Database migration example, database set up and encryption<br>
- Steiho realm browser integration
- This example has two branches: for realm v0.87.4 and for realm v2.2.1 (you can switch between branches)

I use Realm in my weather application which has more than 30 000 users and it shows itself as a great reliable product.
